#Python-DSA-Practice

Welcome to the Python-DSA-Practice.  
This project is focused on helping individuals improve their Python programming skills, starting from basic concepts and advancing toward key data structures and algorithms (DSA).Whether you are a beginner learning Python or someone preparing for coding interviews, this repository is designed to support your learning journey.

## Project Structure

### Basic Python Questions

This section covers fundamental Python topics to build a strong programming foundation.  
It is suitable for beginners or anyone who wants to revise their basics.

Topics include:
- Variables and Data Types  
- Conditionals and Loops  
- Functions  
- Input/Output Handling  
- Basic Programming Logic

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

After covering the basics, the focus shifts to essential DSA topics such as:
- Arrays and Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
- Trees and Graphs (upcoming)

Each topic includes problems and solutions implemented in Python, with clear explanations to reinforce understanding.

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python programming  
- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming  
- Provide organized and well-documented code for reference and learning

## Language

- Python

## Final Note

This is a continuous learning project. More problems and solutions will be added over time as I explore new concepts and improve my skills.  
Feel free to explore the code, use it for your own practice, or contribute if you're on a similar learning path.

Let's keep learning and improving through code. ðŸ™‚
